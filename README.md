# Introduction

This project dedicates to completing the final project in the Experimental Design & A/B Testing course by Paccman. Marketing campaigns can be optimized through A/B testing, which involves modifying a specific aspect of a campaign and comparing the results of two versions. A marketing firm conducted an A/B test comparing public service announcements (PSA) and advertisements to determine which message type would be more effective in increasing user conversions. The report will summarize the methodology, data analysis, and conclusions of the A/B test.

# Setting Up Problem
## Experiment Goal

The company will conduct an A/B test to determine whether advertisements or public service announcements (PSAs) will be more effective in increasing user conversion rates. The experiment will randomly assign users to either a PSA or ad group and measure their conversion rates, with the aim of determining the optimal marketing strategy to increase revenue.

## Metric

In the experiment, the conversion rate is the driver metric, which the company seeks to increase to boost revenue. A guardrail metric, the bounce rate, will be monitored to prevent any unintended negative effects on other aspects of the business. If the bounce rate significantly increases after implementing the new marketing strategy, the company may need to adjust its approach to avoid any negative impact on user behavior.

## Variants

1. **Control Group**: The control group will be exposed to PSA, which is the current marketing strategy
used by the company. The control group will be used as a baseline to compare the performance of the
test group.
2. **Treatment Group**: The treatment group will be exposed to ads, which is the new marketing strategy
that the company is considering. The test group will be used to determine the effectiveness of the new
marketing strategy

## Hypothesis

- $H_0$ : The conversion rate of the control group (PSA) is equal to or lower than the conversion rate of
the treatment group (ads).

- $H_1$ : The conversion rate of the treatment group (ads) is higher than the conversion rate of the control
group (PSA).

In simpler terms, the null hypothesis ($H_0$) for this experiment is that there is no difference in conversion
rates between the control group (PSA) and the treatment group (ads). The alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) is
that the conversion rate of the treatment group (ads) is higher than the conversion rate of the control group
(PSA)
